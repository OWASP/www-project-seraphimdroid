**OWASP Seraphimdroid encourages students and University lecturers to contribute to the projects. We would like to encourage any BSc, 3rd year or master project ideas that would improve Seraphimdroid app. Project leaders are willing to co-supervise these projects. Please contact us if you are interested. At the end of the page are listed some of the potential project ideas, but we encourage you to send us your ideas as well.**

## Behavioral malware and intrusion analysis
### Brief Explanation:

OWASP Seraphimdroid is an Android mobile app which already has a capability to statically analyze malware using machine learning (weka toolkit) relying on permissions. However, this is usually not enough and we intend to improve this with behavioral analysis. There are a number of paper in scientific literature describing how to detect malware and intrusions by dynamically analyzing its behavior (system calls, battery consumption, etc.). The idea of this project is to find the best approach that can be implemented on the device and implement it. **

### Expected Results:

* Reviewing scientific literature and find feasible approach we can take
* Implement and possibly improve the approach in Seraphimdroid
* Test the model and provide controls to switch algorithm on or off and possibly fine tune it
*Documenting approach as a technical report

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
* Java
* Android
* CSV, XML
* Basic knowledge and interest in machine learning

### Mentors:

* Nikola Milosevic - OWASP Seraphimdroid Project Leader

## Framework for plugin development

### Brief Explanation:

OWASP Seraphimdroid is well rounded security and privacy app, however, it lacks some components community can provide. We would like to provide community the way to develop plugins that can add features to OWASP Seraphimdroid app. However, the way of integrating external components into Android app may be challenge. The way of presenting GUI and integration between processes need to be examined and developed.

### Expected Results:

* Examining the way of integrating third party apps through some provided API to OWASP Seraphimdroid
* Providing GUI integration with third party components
* Develop at least one test plugin
* Document the development process and API

### Knowledge Prerequisites:

* Java
* Android
* CSV, XML

### Mentors:

* Nikola Milosevic - OWASP Seraphimdroid Project Leader
